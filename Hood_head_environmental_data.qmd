title: "Hood Head environmental data"
---

Hood Head site is located within [Blue Dot Sea Farm](https://bluedotseafarms.com/). Blue Dot Sea Farm is a subtidal shellfish and seaweed farm. Environmental monitoring instruments are deployed on hanging [SEAPA](https://seapausa.com/oyster-baskets/) oyster cages or suspended directly from backbone lines.

## Site Location

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
aquaculturemap_hood <- leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.OceanBasemap) %>%
  addMarkers(lng = -122.612914,lat = 47.884253, popup = "Hood Head - Blue Dot Sea Farm") #Hood Head
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
aquaculturemap_hood
```

<Br>Raw data can be found [here](https://github.com/CraigNorrie/Environmental-data-website/tree/main/Data)<Br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#Sumarise the data
#turn this into a loop that will do this for each of the cvs files that I have in the data folder
hooddat <- read.csv(here("Data", "hood_Do_Temp.csv"))#Read in the data
hooddat$datetime <- mdy_hm(hooddat$Date.Time..GMT.07.00)
#Obtain daily mean data - this should probably be done in a seperate script and this should be saved for the website only
hoodav <- hooddat %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(meantemp = mean(Temp_C, na.rm = TRUE),
            meanDO = mean(DO_mgL, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## Temperature data

Temperature data was collected from hobo DO and temp logger.  Data was collected every 15 minutes and daily averages were calculated.<Br>

The hobo logger was lost from this stite between August and October.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
hood_temp_plot <- hoodav %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = meantemp))+geom_line()+xlab("Date")+ylab("Temperature (Â°C)")+theme_bw()

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplotly(hood_temp_plot)
```

## Disolved oxygen data

Dissolved oxygen data was collected using a hobo DO and temp logger. Data was collected every 15 minutes and daily averages were calculated. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
hood_do_plot <- hoodav %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = meanDO))+geom_line()+xlab("Date")+ylab("Disolved oxygen (mg/L)")+theme_bw()#+geom_blank()

ggplotly(hood_do_plot)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplotly(hood_do_plot)
```



```{r}
carbchem %>% filter(Site == "Hood Head") %>% select(-c(1,2)) %>%  arrange(Year, Month)
```
