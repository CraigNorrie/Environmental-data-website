# Environmental data from aquaculture

Data collected from aquaculture locations throughout Washington

## Map of sites

Click each location on this map to find a list of the data that has been collected at each site and the organisation that has collected this data.

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}

#Set the content for each point on the map
content_thorndyke <- paste("<b>Thorndyke Bay, Baywater Shellfish - UW</b><br/>

I will add plots that show all the data from each site on the same plots.
