title: "Thorndyke Bay environmental data"

Thorndyke Bay monitoring instruments are located within the [Baywater Shellfish](https://www.baywatershellfish.com/) shellfish farm. Baywater shellfish is an intertidal shellfish farm. Environmental monitoring instruments are located on oyster lines that are anchored into the ground and are exposed every tidal cycle.

# Site Location
Sensors at Thorndyke Bay are deployed on a commercial shellfish farm. The sensors are located in an intertidal area at a tidal height of approximatley x cm.

I will change the basemap here so you can zoom in more

<Br>Raw data is availble [here](https://github.com/CraigNorrie/Environmental-data-website/tree/main/Data)<Br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#Sumarise the data
#turn this into a loop that will do this for each of the cvs files that I have in the data folder
thorndat <- read.csv(here("Data", "thorn_Do_Temp.csv"))#Read in the data
thorndat$datetime <- mdy_hm(thorndat$Date.Time..GMT.07.00)
#Obtain daily mean data - this should probably be done in a seperate script and this should be saved for the website only
thornav <- thorndat %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(meantemp = mean(Temp_C, na.rm = TRUE),
            meanDO = mean(DO_mgL, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## Temperature data

Temperature data was collected from hobo DO and temp logger.  Data was collected every 15 minutes and daily averages were calculated. Note this data included information from when individuals were out of the water. <Br>

We can include additional lines with differtent colours for each of the locations within thorndyke to compare. 
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
Thorn_temp_plot <- thornav %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = meantemp))+geom_line()+xlab("Date")+ylab("Temperature (Â°C)")+theme_bw()

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplotly(Thorn_temp_plot)
```

## Disolved oxygen data

Dissolved oxygen data was collected using a hobo DO and temp logger. Data was collected every 15 minutes and daily averages were calculated. Note this data included information from when individuals were out of the water

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
Thorn_do_plot <- thornav %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = meanDO))+geom_line()+xlab("Date")+ylab("Disolved oxygen (mg/L)")+theme_bw()

ggplotly(Thorn_do_plot)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplotly(Thorn_do_plot)
```
