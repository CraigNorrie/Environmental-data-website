Background info about this. 


```{r, include=FALSE}
#Load the packages required to make a local scale map
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)#package to make interactive web
library(leaflet.providers)#allows you to add third party basemaps

## Site information

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
aquaculturemap_chel <- leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.OceanBasemap) %>%
  addMarkers(lng = -122.960441,lat = 47.127609, popup = "South Sound - Chelsea Farms")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
aquaculturemap_chel
```

<Br>Here will be a link to the raw data<Br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
#Sumarise the data
#turn this into a loop that will do this for each of the cvs files that I have in the data folder
cheldat <- read.csv(here("Data", "chelsea_Do_Temp.csv"))#Read in the data
cheldat$datetime <- mdy_hm(cheldat$Date.Time..GMT.07.00)
#Obtain daily mean data - this should probably be done in a seperate script and this should be saved for the website only
chelav <- cheldat %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(meantemp = mean(Temp_C, na.rm = TRUE),
            meanDO = mean(DO_mgL, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## Temperature data

Temperature data was collected from hobo DO and temp logger.  Data was collected every 15 minutes and daily averages were calculated. Note this data included information from when individuals were out of the water. <Br>

The hobo logger was lost from this stite between August and October.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
chel_temp_plot <- chelav %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = meantemp))+geom_line()+xlab("Date")+ylab("Temperature (Â°C)")+theme_bw()

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplotly(chel_temp_plot)
```

## Disolved oxygen data

Dissolved oxygen data was collected using a hobo DO and temp logger. Data was collected every 15 minutes and daily averages were calculated. Note this data included information from when individuals were out of the water

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
chel_do_plot <- chelav %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = meanDO))+geom_line()+xlab("Date")+ylab("Disolved oxygen (mg/L)")+theme_bw()

ggplotly(chel_do_plot)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplotly(chel_do_plot)
```
